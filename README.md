Virtual Machine Learning Internship Program

During the internship, i have hands-on experience on five real-world projects

- Table of Contents:

1- Housing price prediction using Multiple Linear Regression algorithm.

2- Clustering using K-Means algorithm.

3- Classification using Support Vector Machine SVM algorithm.

4- Hand Gesture classification using Deep Learning - Convolutional Neural Network CNN architecture.

5- Food Classification then identify calories using Deep Learning.

  
in addition to the part of Data Analysis, Preprocessing and Visualization.
